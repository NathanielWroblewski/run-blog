  Tonight was the first night I've run without music, and the run seemed a lot
  harder.  I felt shin splints about 1.5-2 miles in, which really slowed me
  down.  This is the first time I've felt pain while running, and I can't help
  but wonder if these were my first shin splints or if it was
  because I didn't have music to distract me.

  Throughout the run, my pace felt slowed because of the pain, but looking at
  the data afterwards, it wasn't that bad of a run.  I stayed within the
  8-9 min/mi range, which is where I wanted to be.

  The Garmin is nice in that it doesn't bounce around like my phone but also
  because it tracks a wealth of metrics that my phone simply can't.  The
  one I'm focusing on improving first is going to be cadence, because its the
  most well-studied.  Starting with a 5% increase in cadence should increase my
  pace significantly.  To do so, I'm going shopping for a lightweight, digital
  metronome that I can wear while I run.  Over time, I'm hoping I'll adopt the metronome's tempo as my own.
