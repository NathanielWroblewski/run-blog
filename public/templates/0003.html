<h2>SLOW OFF THE MARK</h2>
<div id="map">

<p>
  Tonight felt like an all-out sprint.  I gassed after a short while, which is evident in the run data, and I had to call it after 3 miles.  The excuse I
  told myself was that I had just run 5 miles last night.  Looking back, I wish
  I had kept pushing.

  I approached the run with something new in mind.  I had just read an article
  earlier in the day that demonstrated how faster speeds were attained not by
  faster leg movements but by applying greater ground forces.  Throughout the
  run, I experiemented with really pushing off the ground, and while I went
  faster, I also felt I had to increase my leg speed and felt that it wasn't a
  maintainable pace.  I believe the burst indicates that I should be running at
  a pace somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00 minutes/mile though.
</p>
<p>
  Trends are starting to emerge in the data, and I can see that I've been
  getting off to a slow start.  I'm going to try warming-up beforehand tonight
  to see if that helps.  Let's hope it works!

  Because tracking my runs had such a profound improvement on my running, and I
  expect it to contribute to even greater improvements, I went ahead and
  splurged on a Garmin Forerunner 610 with heart rate monitor.  Previously, I've
  been using the Runkeeper app on my phone, but running with the phone was
  awkward.  The phone bounced out of my pocket one time, so the next time I ran,
  I wrapped my phone in rubberbands and tied a bowline knot around them and my
  neck creating a makeshift lanyard.  It worked alright as long as I kept it
  tucked under my shirt, but it was clear I needed some sort of upgrade.
