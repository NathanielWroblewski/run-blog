  I'm a big guy. At 6'1" and 220lbs., I probably shouldn't even be running in
  the first place. But I promised a friend of mine that I'd run a marathon
  with her, and I'm a man of my word. Her goal is to qualify for Boston; mine
  is to keep up. That means running 26.2 miles in 3 hours and 30 minutes,
  flat 8 minute miles, which right now, is unfathomable.

  You're joining me right now in a pretty sorry state. I'm slow,
  I've got bum knees, and every time I run, my teeth hurt for some reason.
  After tracking my first run, I discovered that I was pulling down 11 minute
  miles. That's not even running by most standards. That's <em>jogging</em>.
  But despite terrible form and a body that jogs when I really mean for it to
  run, I'm not giving up just yet.

  Mostly because I really want to do this. I want to see if I <em>can</em> do
  this. I'm hoping that with running, I'll get out more, see more of the world,
  and get a new perspective on things.

  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of time between now and the marathon in
  December, so I'll need to try a lot of different things to see what works.
  Aside from being an attempt to keep me motivated, this blog is a chance for me
  to organize those experiences, reflect on my runs, and identify what works.
