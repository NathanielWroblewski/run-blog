  I'm a big guy. At 6'1" and 220lbs., I probably shouldn't even be running in
  the first place. But I promised a friend of mine that I'd run a marathon
  with her, and I'm a man of my word. Her goal is to qualify for Boston; mine
  is to keep up. That means running 26.2 miles in 3 hours and 30 minutes,
  flat 8 minute miles, which right now, is unfathomable. This is a blog
  about tracking runs, making sacrifices, and getting good in a short amount of
  time.

  You join me in a pretty sorry state. I'm slow, I've got bum knees, and every
  time I run, my teeth hurt for some reason. After tracking my first run, I
  discovered that I was pulling down 11 minute miles. That's not even running
  by most standards. That's <em>jogging</em>. But despite my terrible form and my body
  jogging when I really mean for it to run, I'm not about to give up just yet.
</p>
<p>
  Mostly because I really want to do this. I want to see if I <em>can</em> do
  this. I'm also hoping that by running, I'll get out more, see more of the
  world, and get a new perspective on things.
</p>
<p>
  Because I don't have much time before the race in December, I'm going to be
  trying a lot of different things, to get as good as I can in as short a time
  as possible. I promise to take measurements and post the results, so if
  you've got some time between now and December, join me on my adventure,
  and we can learn together as I run by the numbers.
