  I'm a big guy.  At 6'1" and 220lbs., I probably shouldn't even be running in
  the first place.  But I promised a friend of mine that I'd run a marathon
  with her, and I'm a man of my word.  Her goal is to qualify for Boston; mine
  is to keep up.  That means running 26.2 miles in 3 hours and 30 minutes,
  flat 8 minute miles, which right now, is unfathomable.  This is a blog
  about tracking runs, making sacrifices, and getting good in a short amount of
  time.

  You join me in a pretty sorry state.  I'm slow, I've got bum knees, and every
  time I run, my teeth hurt for some reason.  After tracking my first run, I
  discovered that I was pulling down 11 minute miles.  That's not even running
  by most standards.  That's jogging.
</p>
<p>
  As a runner, you'll read a lot of books that talk about perfect form, but
  despite my best efforts, I seem to be embracing the imperfect form, something
  akin to an injured buffalo.  While I've only just started this running thing,
  I'm not off to a very good start, but despite my hideous form and my body
  jogging when I really mean it to run, I'm not about to give up just yet.
</p>
<p>
  Mostly because I really want to do this.  I want to see if I <em>can</em> do
  this.  I'm also hoping that by running, I'll get out more, see more of the
  world, and get a new perspective on things.
</p>
<p>
  Because I don't have much time before the race in December, I'm going to try
  several different approaches to running, and unlike other sites out there,
  I'll be measuring the differences and posting the results.  Hopefully, its
  these experiences that you can learn from.
</p>
<p>
  If you've got some time between now and December, join me on my adventure as I
  run by the numbers.
