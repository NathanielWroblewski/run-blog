  After seeing how far behind I was, I knew I really had to push.  The
  improvement was significant.  From 11 minute miles to 9 minute miles
  overnight.  Beginning to track my runs was a huge first step just in changing
  my mentality: knowing I had to push harder, rather than being content with
  my pace.

  The success was accompanied by a daunting realization.  This is going to be
  much harder than I expected.  I ran hard, pushing myself through periods I
  really wanted to rest.  I was able to finish 5 miles at that pace, but 26?
